I am a software engineer experienced in performing requirement analysis, designing and developing distributed, database-driven solution incorporating web and desktop interface.

Currently staying in the beautiful Sydney, I love to be part of the dynamic IT scene and contribute my skills. My peers describe me as someone who is passionate about the latest technologies and dedicated. 

If you have a burning question about software development, shoot me an email and I'll do my best to answer it.
