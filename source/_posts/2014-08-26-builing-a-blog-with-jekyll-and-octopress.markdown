Recently, I was looking to start a portfolio site to showcase my development work. I was contemplated to use the usual wordpress blogging platform until I found out about the whole static page thing with Octopress via Github.

What is Octopress?

In its own words, Octopress introduce itself as a blogging platform for hackers. Basically that means you need to be a geek to know how to set it up.

Actually, I first bumbed into Github Pages which sounds kind cool because you get to version your HTML pages and it will be hosted free (yay!). After playing around with it, I found out that Github Pages made use of Jekyll to generate the static HTMLs. More googling led me to another thing called Octopress, which is a platform built on top of Jekyll so I can use Octopress to generate Jekyll static content and have it uploaded and hosted on Github. Sounds like a plan!
