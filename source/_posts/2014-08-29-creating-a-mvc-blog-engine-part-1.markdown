I have been working on a ASP.NET MVC pet project of my own for a while, following tutorial from [PrideParriot](http://www.prideparrot.com/blog/archive/2012/12/how_to_create_a_simple_blog_part1) to build a blog engine from scratch. Ultimately, I intend to divert from the tutorial to add more functionalities as I get more comfortable. <!--more-->

For the time being, I have completed the user stores below for the blog engine:

* Story #1 - Display the latest blog posts
* Story #2 - Display posts based on category
* Story #3 - Display posts based on tag
* Story #4 - Search posts
* Story #5 - Display the details of a single post
* Story #6 - Display the post categories in a widget
* Story #7 - Display the post tags in a widget
* Story #8 - Display the latest posts in a widget

More work needs to be done!
