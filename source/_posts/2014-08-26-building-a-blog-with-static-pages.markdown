Recently, I was looking to start a portfolio site to present my development work. I was contemplated to use the usual [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com) blogging platform until I found out about the whole static page thing with [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) via [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com).

#What is Octopress?

In its own words, Octopress is a blogging platform for hackers. Basically that means you will need to be a geek to know how to set it up. Challenge accepted!

Follow the [setup instruction here](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/) to get it up and running. Generally, getting it to work in OSX is much easier than Windows due to OSX's underlying unix architecture. After that it is all about wrtting your post in Markdown syntax to have it generated and deployed.
